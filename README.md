# Welcome to OCTO's Website Repo

The Website is currently live @ [octo.asuc.org](https://octo.asuc.org/)

Due to technical limitations, we are keeping the code and the deploy on two separate repos.

The React repo is available [here](https://github.com/OCTO-Marketing/octo-react) under the OCTO-Marketing team.

The deploy repo is avilable [here](https://github.com/asuc-octo/octo-website) under the asuc-octo team

## About the Website

The design of the website was passed down through the history of OCTO. Throughout that time, small bugs and design inconsistencies have accumulated on various pages, which is why we rewrote the entire website.

The new website is built with the React.js + Typescript framework, Tailwind.css for styling, and React-Icons for icons.

If you are interested in the technology behind this rather simple, straightforward website, feel free to reach out to AZ at [azz@berkeley.edu](mailto:azz@berkeley.edu). If you are interested in joining the team that maintains the OCTO website, head over to the [apply](https://octo.asuc.org/apply) page and check out the section for the Website team.
