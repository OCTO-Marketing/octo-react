# Welcome to OCTO's Website Repo

The Website is currently live @ [octo.asuc.org](https://octo.asuc.org/)

Due to technical limitations, we are not able to build directly from the repo. Instead, we are using two separate branches for the ready-to-deploy build and the code.

The React branch is available [here](https://github.com/asuc-octo/octo-website/tree/dev).

The deploy branch is avilable [here](https://github.com/asuc-octo/octo-website).

## About the Website

The design of the website was passed down through the history of OCTO. Throughout that time, small bugs and design inconsistencies have accumulated on various pages, which is why we rewrote the entire website.

The new website is built with the React.js + Typescript framework, Tailwind.css for styling, and React-Icons for icons.

If you are interested in the technology behind this rather simple, straightforward website, feel free to reach out to AZ at [azz@berkeley.edu](mailto:azz@berkeley.edu).
